    "What do the alphabet and the programming language Python have in common? Right, both start with ABC. If we are talking about ABC in the Python context, it's clear that the programming language ABC is meant. ABC is a general-purpose programming language and programming environment, which had been developed in the Netherlands, Amsterdam, at the CWI (Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica). The greatest achievement of ABC was to influence the design of Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python was conceptualized in the late 1980s. Guido van Rossum worked that time in a project at the CWI, called Amoeba, a distributed operating system. In an interview with Bill Venners1, Guido van Rossum said: \"In the early 1980s, I worked as an implementer on a team building a language called ABC at Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica (CWI). I don't know how well people know ABC's influence on Python. I try to mention ABC's influence because I'm indebted to everything I learned during that project and to the people who worked on it.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Later on in the same Interview, Guido van Rossum continued: \"I remembered all my experience and some of my frustration with ABC. I decided to try to design a simple scripting language that possessed some of ABC's better properties, but without its problems. So I started typing. I created a simple virtual machine, a simple parser, and a simple runtime. I made my own version of the various ABC parts that I liked. I created a basic syntax, used indentation for statement grouping instead of curly braces or begin-end blocks, and developed a small number of powerful data types: a hash table (or dictionary, as we call it), a list, strings, and numbers.\""

    "So, what about the name \"Python\": Most people think about snakes, and even the logo depicts two snakes, but the origin of the name has its root in British humour. Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, wrote in 1996 about the origin of the name of his programming language1: \"Over six years ago, in December 1989, I was looking for a 'hobby' programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas. My office ... would be closed, but I had a home computer, and not much else on my hands. I decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language I had been thinking about lately: a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers. I chose Python as a working title for the project, being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus).\" "

    "Guido Van Rossum published the first version of Python code (version 0.9.0) at alt.sources in February 1991. This release included already exception handling, functions, and the core data types of list, dict, str and others. It was also object oriented and had a module system. \n",

The emphasis in Python 3 had been on the removal of duplicate programming constructs and modules, thus fulfilling or coming close to fulfilling the 13th law of the Zen of Python: \"There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it.\" \n",

    "Most probably you will have read somewhere that the Python language is an interpreted programming or a script language. The truth is: Python is both an interpreted and a compiled language. But calling Python a compiled language would be misleading. (At the end of this chapter, you will find the definitions for Compilers and Interpreters, if you are not familiar with the concepts!) People would assume that the compiler translates the Python code into machine language. Python code is translated into intermediate code, which has to be executed by a virtual machine, known as the PVM, the Python virtual machine. This is a similar approach to the one taken by Java. There is even a way of translating Python programs into Java byte code for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This can be achieved with Jython. \n",

    "The question is, do I have to compile my Python scripts to make them faster or how can I compile them? The answer is easy: Normally, you don't need to do anything and you shouldn't bother, because \"Python\" is doing the thinking for you, i.e. it takes the necessary steps automatically. \n",

    "But as we have said, you don't have to and shouldn't bother about compiling Python code. The compilation is hidden from the user for a good reason. Some newbies to Python wonder sometimes where these ominous files with the .pyc suffix might come from. If Python has write-access for the directory where the Python program resides, it will store the compiled byte code in a file that ends with a .pyc suffix. If Python has no write access, the program will work anyway. The byte code will be produced but discarded when the program exits.\n",
    "Whenever a Python program is called, Python will check, if there exists a compiled version with the .pyc suffix. This file has to be newer than the file with the .py suffix. If such a file exists, Python will load the byte code, which will speed up the start up time of the script. If there exists no byte code version, Python will create the byte code before it starts the execution of the program. Execution of a Python program means execution of the byte code on the Python Virtual Machine (PVM). \n",

    "It's a one to one encoding, i.e. it takes each Unicode character (a 4-byte number) and stores it in 4 bytes. One advantage of this encoding is that you can find the Nth character of a string in linear time, because the Nth character starts at the 4×Nth byte. A serious disadvantage of this approach is due to the fact that it needs four bytes for every character.\n",
    "## UTF-16\n",
    "Hardly anybody needs more than 65535 characters, so UTF-16, which needs 2 bytes, is a more space efficient alternative to UTF-32. But it is very difficult to access characters outside the range 0 - 65535, i.e. characters from the so-called \"astral plane\"\n",
    "Another problem of both UTF-32 and UTF-16 consists in the byte ordering, which is depending on the operating system.\n",
    "## UTF-8\n",
    "UTF8 is a variable-length encoding system for Unicode, i.e. different characters take up a different number of bytes. ASCII characters use solely one byte per character, which are even the same as the used to be for the first 128 characters (0127), i.e. these characters in UTF-8 are indistinguishable from ASCII. But the so-called \"Extended Latin\" characters like the Umlaute ä, ö and so on take up two bytes. Chinese characters need three bytes. Finally, the very seldom used characters of the \"astral plane\" need four bytes to be encoded in UTF-8. \n",
    "A Disadvantage of this approach is that finding the Nth character is more complex, the longer the string, the longer it takes to find a specific character. "
