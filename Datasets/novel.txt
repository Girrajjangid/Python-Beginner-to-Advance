In the following example we will use sets to determine the different words occurring in a novel. Our use case is build around a novel which has been praised by many as the best novel in the English language and also as the hardest to read. We are talking about the novel "Ulysses" by James Joyce. We will not talk about or examine the beauty of the language or the language style. We will study the novel by having a close look at the words used in the novel. Our approach will be purely statitically. The claim is that James Joyce used in his novel more words than any other author. Actually his vocabulary is above and beyond all other authors, maybe even Shakespeare.
