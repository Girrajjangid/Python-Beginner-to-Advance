    "doctest is a test framework that comes prepackaged with Python. The doctest module searches for pieces of text that look like interactive Python sessions inside of the documentation parts of a module, and then executes (or reexecutes) the commands of those sessions to verify that they work exactly as shown, i.e. that the same results can be achieved. In other words: The help text of the module is parsed, for example, python sessions. These examples are run and the results are compared against the expected value."

It is not only possible, it is the un­der­ly­ing idea of test-dri­ven de­vel­opment. In the extreme case, you define tests be­fore you start coding the actual source code. The program developer writes an automated test case which defines the desired \"behaviour\" of a function. This test case will - that's the idea behind the approach - initially fail, because the code has still to be written.\n",
